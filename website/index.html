    <h1 class="body-heading">About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Matt, a 28 year old Brooklyn resident, hailing from Long Island. I've been living in NYC for the better part of a decade and can think of no other place that I would want to call home. I first move to New York City in 2007, transferring from SUNY Binghamton to CUNY Hunter. At Hunter, I majored in media studies, and worked as a camera intern for the production company The People's DP. After college, I continued to work for the People's DP as a freelance production assistant, and also started working as a major part of the production company CongestedCat. With CongestedCat, I worked as an assistant director and editor and was able to be a part of some really great projects, including the feature film Summit, and the web series Kelsey. Aside from my career in film, I also worked for the financial training company, Fitch Learning. Originally brought on as a video editor for their online content and as a webcaster, I worked my way up the corporate ladder, eventually becoming the Business Development Executive for our CFA products. However, after doing sales for a few years, I realized that it really wasn't for me, and that where I'm most happy and productive is when collaborating with others on long term projects.
    </p>
    <p>
    Aside from work related endeavors, I am also a musician, currently playing guitar/bass with a band, an avid reader, a fan of animation, and an enthusiastic whiskey and gin drinker!
